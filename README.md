# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
-The overview of this analysis is to compare Louise's fundraising efforts to other comparable efforts. Her fundraising efforts for her show, Fever, were successful. 

### Purpose
-The purpose of this project was to analyze the data and provide quick and visual analysis of the goals laid out by Louise. Which, again to summarize, are to compare and contrast her fundraising efforts with other similar projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
-I performed my analysis by following the instructions provided and using my pre-existing knowledge of Excel. I did not face any challenges, as both the instructions were clear and my pre-exsiting knowledge of Excel allowed for smooth data analysis. For deliverable 1, I used a PivotTable to find the most accurate data. Using the filters of "Parent Category" and "Year", the Columns of "Outcomes", the row of "Date Created Conversion", and the values of "Count of outcomes", I was able to find the relevant data. For the Outcomes Based on Goals, I used the countifs function in Excel to match the relevant data with the appropriate cell. I then used the percentage data to create an accurate graph to visualize the data regarding the success rate of fundraisers based on their stated goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-Two conclusions based on the date is that projects started in May and June were the most successful, while projects started in May and July were the least successful. Additionally, the month of december showed closest match to Successful and Failed campaigns, with 37 successful to 35 failed campaigns. In all other months, there were significantly more successful campaigns than failed campaigns. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-Based on the data and the graph for Outcomes Based on Goals, I can find that the most successful campaigns had the lowest goal, with campaigns with goals less than 1000 having a 75.81% rate. Meanwhile, campaigns with higher goals were less likely to be successful. Campaigns with the goal of 45000 or more failed 11 times, with only 2 being successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-Projects in May and June were most successful
-Projects in December were the least successful

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-Campaigns with the lowest goals were the most successful, while campaigns with the highest goals were the least successful

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-The dataset does not account for effort, extrenuating circumstances, and fundraising network

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Success rate by year
-Success rate by country
-Outcomes by spotlight status
